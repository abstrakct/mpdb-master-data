The wind blows the hair from your face
while you’re waiting by the porch
on this July sunny day
I see from the look in your eyes that you’re worried:
will he come today?

You won’t be here tomorrow morning,
but you said that yesterday as well
I bet I’ll see you here all summer:
waiting for the one who went away

The blueberry-dress is the one you’ll be wearing,
cos that’s the one that he said he liked
and maybe tomorrow he’ll be returning,
and all will be alright

you won’t be here...............etc
